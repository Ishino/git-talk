# What is Git?
> "Git is a free & open source, distributed version control system designed to 
> handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."  

* Distributed
* Open Source
* Fast
* Created by Linus Torvalds (Linux)

# Basic Git Usage
* Initialize a repo: `git init`
* Add files to the index: `git add -A` or `git add .`
* Commit files: `git commit`

# History

# The Index (Staging Area)
The index contains the changes to will be added to your next commit. Your commit will /not/ contain the changes in your working directory. Only the changes that were added to the index!

![git-02](img/git-02.png)

# The Index (Staging Area)
If you add a file, or a part of a file, to the index, a copy is made of that file. When you commit, it is that copy which ends up in the commit.

**Important**: if you make changes to the file after adding it to the index, those changes will 
not end up in your commit, unless you add the file again to the index!

    `git diff`  
    # shows the diff of your working copy

    `git diff --cached`
    # show the diff of your index

Let's make some more changes and add some of these changes to the index.

# Undoing changes
## Checkout
Checkout a single file. Notice the dashes: `git checkout` is also used in other cases, this makes it clear to Git that you are pointing to a single file.
    git checkout -- /path/to/file    # restore version from index
    git checkout HEAD /path/to/file  # restore to latest committed version


## Reset
Reset all the changes in your working copy
    git reset [--hard]

## Revert
Write a reversed version of an existing commit. This is very useful if you have already pushed the commit
    git revert [commit-sha]

## Rebase
We'll discuss this later

# How Git stores your data
Knowing how Git stores all your data will give you a better understanding of the fundamentals and Git will become a lot more predictable

The most important point to remember:  
   
** Basically a Git repository is a database of objects **

# How Git stores your data
The most important types of objects:

* blobs
* trees
* commits

Let's study those in a bit more detail

# Blobs

Git stores the _contents_ of a file in a 'blob'.

* does not contain any meta data
* a blob never changes
* a hash is calculated as the blob name
* the hash will always be the same for the same contents

some examples:

    $ git hash-object hello.txt
    ce6c1fd146f65c899e6b10e46c89097c644e3229
    
    $ git hash-object say-hi.rb
    a8784b043f12b4b0c9114c55ebf33f5c9b44ce8f

# Trees
A tree is a like a directory

* Can contain references to 0, 1 or more blobs
* Can contain references to 0, 1 or more other trees
* Contains the meta data about the files
* Itself also identified by a hash

![git-03](img/git-03_2.png)

# Commits
If you think about Git, think about commits!

* Contains a reference to one tree object
* Contains references to one or more other commits
   * one exception: the very first commit in the repo
* A commit usually points to it's parent commit
* In case of a merge, it can point to two or more commits (one commit for each branch which you merged together)

# Commits

![git-04](img/git-04.png)

Did I mention that you should think in terms of commits, when working with Git?  

If you understand commits, you basically understand Git.

# Git References or "refs"

Because a commit hash is very difficult to remember and not really useful to work with, Git uses references to point to specific commits.

## HEAD
One such reference is **HEAD**

* It points to the commit which is currently checked out into your working directory

## master
Another important reference is **master**

* master is the 'default' branch in Git
* when working on the master branch, the master reference and the HEAD reference point to the same commit

And that brings us to...

# Branches

Branches in Git are basically just references to other commits

* very easy to create
* once you get the hang of it, you will probably create branches for almost every feature you want to implement
* a branch has a name
* this name is also the reference to the most recent commit for that branch
* a commit can be shared by branches
* The point where a branch is split of from another branch, can be found by following the parents of all the commits until you find a common commit

# Branches
Creating a branch and switching to it is easy:

    git branch mywork
    
    git checkout mywork

The two previous commands can be combined:

    git checkout -b mywork

This will create a branch and immediately check it out.

Once you have merged your work on a specific feature back into your master branch you can delete your feature branch:

    git branch -d mywork


# Branches

* We are working on a branch named 'origin'
* At commit C2 we decide to split off a new branch named 'mywork'.
* Both branches originate from commit C2; commit C3 and C5 have the same parent

![git-05](img/git-05.png)

# Merging

When you have been working on a (feature) branch for a while you will probably want to merge it back into your master or develop branch (whatever name you use for it)

    # checkout the target branch
    git checkout master
    # merge our mywork branch into master
    git merge mywork

Now your repository looks like this: (Notice that commit C7 has two parents)
![git-06](img/git-06.png)

# Merging

When merging two or more branches there are two possibilities:

* Merge commit
* Fast Forward  


## Merge commit
* When both branches have new commits a merge commit is created.
* Git automatically proposes a commit message:  

    `Merge branch 'mywork' into master`
* The commit has two or more parents

# Merging
##Fast Forward
* When the target branch does not have new commits
* No merge commit is created
* In fact nothing much happens
* Except: The reference for the target branch is simply changed to point the same commit as the source branch
* This is an ideal situation and can never go wrong
* Obviously you are not always this lucky (â†’ rebasing)

# Merging 
## Fast Forward
![git-07-before](img/git-07-before.png) Merge the 'mywork' branch into origin
![git-07-after](img/git-07-after.png) The origin branch is simply fast-forwarded

# Rebasing
Instead of merging (with merge commits) you can also rebase (so you can then fast forward)

Some people will tell you that this is very harmful, it can break your repository and destroy the universe.  
This is **NOT TRUE**. (At least if you know what you are doing)

## So what is 'rebasing'?
By rebasing your commits you can actually rewrite your history:

* Edit a commit message
* Add missing files to a commit
* Reorder your commits
* Modify the parent of a commit
* Merge a few commits together into a single commit
* Delete commits from the history
* ...
* And break your repository if you want :)

# Rebasing
## How not to break your repo?

Do not rebase commits which have already been pushed to other people  

Do not rebase commits which have already been pushed to other people  

Do not rebase commits which have already been pushed to other people  

(_I'l explain how to push later_)

If you do rebase a commit which was already pushed, Git will refuse the new commit, unless you use the `--force` option.

# Rebasing
## Amending changes

* The easiest and 'safest' kind of rebase 
* Only possible for the most recent commit
* Let's you add missing files and modify the commit message  

After modifying your index again:

    git commit --amend

# Rebasing
## ... on another branch
This is an alternative approach to merging, with a merge commit.

Let's reuse the example:

![git-05](img/git-05.png)

Now you  want to merge 'mywork' into 'origin' without creating a merge commit

# Rebasing
## ... on another branch
What we did before:

    git checkout origin
    git merge mywork

What we will do know

    # on the mywork branch
    git rebase origin
    # fix any merge conflicts
    git checkout origin
    git merge mywork

# Rebasing
## ... on another branch

    # on the mywork branch
    git rebase origin
